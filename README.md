## Creating a new image

The easiest way to create a new image is to copy an existing one and change the
base image. If creating from scratch, the images need the following:

* Everything listed in [What's included](#whats-included)
* `make` for internal tooling.
* A _service_ user and group with a GID and UID of 1001. This should be the default
  user.
* A _/service_ directory as the default working directory.
